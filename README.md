# Etudka

![Demo](demo.png)

To practise sight reading, sometimes I need to develop certain skills specifically. This usually ends up crawling the web for "2/4 C major with no accidentals and some chords for the left hand" or "3/4 D minor with some accidentals but no chords". To not waste my time, I've created Etudka. The difference between human-composed etudes is that you can tell the program what characteristics to use, such as a key, time signature, individual notes and so on.

The downside is that it can only generate simple patterns. In future, I am planning to enrich it with repetitions, proper fingering, ledger lines, rests, and more.
